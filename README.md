Welcome to the Madam President project!

This is a multi-faceted effort to create a Mod for the browser game 'The Campaign Trail', particularly for the websites 'The New Campaign Trail' and 'Campaign Trail Showcase'.

The code is split into two parts, a code 1, and a code 2, with the init file being code 1, and the ClintonKaine file being code 2. These designations are for loading the mods in the respective websites.

Currently, the code has been done by Github user StellR7, with writing done by a variety of discord users and 'The Campaign Trail' enthusiasts. 

This Mod is an exploration of what if Hillary Clinton, and Tim Kaine, became President and Vice President of the United States in 2016.

The code and writing is not yet licensed in any fashion.

You may use this code to your leisure!
